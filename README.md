# About This Repository
Construct a rendering context in as many environments as we can.
It's deliberately built to do the least possible work to get a window up.
Later we'll start rendering into these but for now they just clear to random colors..

# Supported Targets
- iOS (iPad, iPhone)
- OSX (MacBook, MacBook Pro)
- Web (Tested on Safari)
